<!--Describe the project, instruction on how to run it, problem domain it address, it needs to be very descriptive-->

## Second week / Lab 4 Assignment

Three of us that were in-person partnered up to do the group project. We had to decide on a topic for the web site and each person will be responsible for 1 page of the site.

### Requirements

1. Together, draw a single wireframe. Instead of on the whiteboard I did it on my iPad and shared it with them via Slack. [Click here](images/WireFrame_Group_Project_Lab4.PNG] to see the mock-up drawing we designed. We will use that layout for all the pages of our site.
    - Keep it at low-fidelity.
    - Identify the general content areas.
    - Think carefully! This is what you are going to code up in markup.

2. Apply html to the structure
    - Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.
    - Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.

3. Choose your verbiage
    - Write out the key content to fill in each page’s content areas of the wireframe.
    - You don’t need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.

4. Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan. <!--we skipped this part-->

5. Write the code!
    - Each partner creates their own repository to work from. How do we get a new repository on our local computer?
    - Each partner codes their own index.html file, matching the wireframe.
    - From this point forward, all your work should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember… A-C-P)
    - Each partner should end up with their own index.html file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different content within the tags.
    - Link up the pages so a user can navigate to both pages.

### Stretch Goal/Bonus Points

Utilize some html tags you’ve never used before.
